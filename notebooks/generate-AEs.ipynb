    "# Generating adversarial examples (AEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This file generates adversarial examples on a dataset with the imagenet network provided by caffe. The data is expected to reside in *data_root*, with the following structure:\n",
    "- The images of each class reside in their own folder, named according to the imagenet label (e.g. 'n02112018')\n",
    "- There are no other folders or files in *data_root*\n",
    "- There are no other folders or files in *data_root*'s class-specific subfolders\n",
    "\n",
    "For each class, a random representative will be selected. Adversarial examples pretending to belong to each class will be generated for it. The program tries to achive *CONFIDENCE_TARGET* certainty of the network, but will not spend longer than *MAX_ITERATIONS* on generating one AE. The number of considered classes can be restricted with *CLASS_LIMIT* (*None* means cross-generate AEs for all classes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is saved to *OUTPUT_ROOT*, with the following structure:\n",
    "- For each class, there is a directory with the class name\n",
    "- The directory contains the AEs as .npy files, with the adversarial class as the filename\n",
    "- There is a history.csv file in each directory that records the final confidence and the required iterations for each AE.\n",
    "- The history.csv file has the format (class_representative_filename, adversarial_class_name, confidence, iterations)\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with imports and by setting paths and constants."
